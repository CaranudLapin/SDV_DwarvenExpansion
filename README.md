# SDV_DwarvenExpansion
A recreation of my Dwarvish mod for Stardew Valley using the expanded modding features available in 1.6

## New Machines

### Dwarven Gem Polisher
Improves the quality of gems to increase their value.
Useful both to increase profit from gems found in the mines as well as to create better quality gems for higher quality jewelry.

### Dwarven Jewelry Making Machine
Turns gems or minerals and gold into fine jewelry.
Turns gemstones and minerals into an artisan good that can be sold for drasticly increased profits.

### Dwarven Pulverizer
Breaks down ore clusters into useful ore, allows you to recycle stone into useful products and can pulverize ore and gems into a fine powder that can be used to brew spirits and make potions.

### Dwarven Still
Brew dwarven spirits and infuse them with the magic of the earth using gem dust.
These spirits can be drank or used as the base for powerful dwarven potions made at the alchemy bench.

### Alchemy Bench
Turns infused dwarven spirits and various ingredients into potions to improve skills, combat ability, health, energy, etc.

### Slow-Burn Charcoal Kiln
A more efficient charcoal kiln that uses a longer lower heat burn to reduce waste and produce more coal per wood at the expense of time.  Harder woods burn more efficiently and produce more coal.

### Improved Mushroom Box
A crystalarium-like mushroom box.  Grows a steady supply of whatever mushroom is placed into it.  Better mushrooms take longer to grow.  Does not produce if placed outdoors.

## New Animals

### Farm Grub
A large grub.  These grubs can be grown and harvested for their meat.  Useful for creating dwarven meals or fishing bait.

### Copper Crab
A mature rock crab.  These crabs filter copper out of their food and the copper grows into thick deposits on their shell which can be scrapped off.  As the crabs age, these deposits can grow into large pure copper clusters, which are broken down in a pulverizer into a large quantity of copper ore.

### Iron Crab
A mature rock crab.  These crabs filter iron out of their food and the iron grows into thick deposits on their shell which can be scrapped off.  As the crabs age, these deposits can grow into large pure iron clusters, which are broken down in a pulverizer into a large quantity of iron ore.

### Gold Crab
A mature lava crab.  These crabs filter gold out of their food and the gold grows into thick deposits on their shell which can be scrapped off.  As the crabs age, these deposits can grow into large pure gold clusters, which are broken down in a pulverizer into a large quantity of gold ore.

### Iridium Crab
A mature lava crab.  These crabs filter iridium out of their food and the iridium grows into thick deposits on their shell which can be scrapped off.  As the crabs age, these deposits can grow into large pure iridium clusters, which are broken down in a pulverizer into a large quantity of iridium ore.

### Giant Naked Molerat
A giant naked molerat.  These molerats are one of the few subterranian mammels dwarves were able to domesticate.  They are used to harvest a thin milk, used frequently in dwarven cooking.

## New Buildings

### Cave/Medium Cave/Large Cave
A farm animal building to house Grubs and Crabs. Level 2 and 3 come with an incubator to pupate grub larva and hatch crab eggs.  Level 3 comes with a feeding chute system that will keep the feeding troughs around the building full.
